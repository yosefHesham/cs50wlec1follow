    <p>Very, very tiny quibble: While Touch-File conforms to the Verb-Noun naming convention of PS, Touch is not an "approved" verb (not that it's a significant requirement: msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428.aspx). File is fine, btw. I recommend the names Set-File or Set-LastWriteTime or, my favorite, Update-File. Also, I would recommend Add-Content $file $null instead of echo $null > $file. Finally, set an alias with Set-Alias touch Update-File if you want to keep using the command touch – Alan McBee M ay 25 '17 at 23:36
Suggest adding this as the last line: New-Alias -Name Touch Touch-File – stimpy77 Oct 1 '19 at 4:33
Nice, but it's better to use New-Item $file instead of echo $null > $file, because the latter will create a 2-byte file with the UTF-16LE BOM in Windows PowerShell (but no longer in PowerShell Core). – mklement0 Nov 5 '19 at 12:43
This has a TOCTTOU race, the file could be created between the check and the action. – poizan42 Dec 27 '19 at 13:43</p>
